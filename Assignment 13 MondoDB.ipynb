    "Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use\n",
    "MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL (non-relational) database management system that is designed for storing, retrieving, and managing large volumes of data in a flexible and scalable manner. MongoDB is known for its document-oriented data model, which means it stores data in a format similar to JSON documents, making it suitable for a wide range of applications and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of non-relational databases and when MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases (NoSQL):\n",
    "Non-relational databases, often referred to as NoSQL databases, are a category of database management systems that depart from the traditional relational database model (SQL databases). They are designed to handle large and complex datasets and offer flexibility, scalability, and performance advantages for certain use cases. Key characteristics of NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema flexibility: NoSQL databases can handle unstructured or semi-structured data and do not require a fixed schema definition.\n",
    "Horizontal scalability: Many NoSQL databases can scale out horizontally by adding more servers or nodes to accommodate increasing data loads.\n",
    "Different data models: NoSQL databases support various data models, including document-oriented, key-value, column-family, and graph databases, to better match specific application needs.\n",
    "When MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases:\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "Semi-structured or rapidly evolving data: MongoDB's flexible schema allows you to store data without a predefined structure. This is beneficial when dealing with data that evolves over time or doesn't fit neatly into a tabular structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability: MongoDB is well-suited for applications with high scalability requirements. It can easily distribute data across multiple servers, making it suitable for handling large amounts of data and high traffic loads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Complex queries: While MongoDB doesn't support the complex querying capabilities of SQL (Structured Query Language), it can handle a wide range of queries. For applications where the need for complex joins and transactions is minimal, MongoDB's query language is sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-time analytics: MongoDB is often used in scenarios where real-time data analysis and processing are required, such as in Internet of Things (IoT) applications, social media platforms, and real-time monitoring systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic and agile development: MongoDB is favored by development teams that need to iterate quickly and make frequent changes to the data model. Its schema-less nature allows for agile development and faster time-to-market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial data: MongoDB has built-in support for geospatial data and queries, making it a preferred choice for applications that involve location-based services."

    "Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database management system known for its flexibility, scalability, and ease of use. It offers a range of features that make it suitable for various application scenarios. Here are some of the key features of MongoDB, along with explanations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-Oriented: MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in BSON (Binary JSON) format. Each data record is a JSON-like document, and documents within a collection (similar to a table in relational databases) can have varying structures, allowing for flexible and dynamic data modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema Flexibility: MongoDB provides schema flexibility, making it ideal for applications with evolving or variable data structures. There's no need to define a fixed schema upfront, and fields can be added or modified in documents as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Highly Scalable: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability, allowing you to distribute data across multiple servers or nodes to handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. This is achieved through sharding, which partitions data across different machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic Sharding: MongoDB provides automatic sharding capabilities, meaning it can automatically distribute data across shards (physical server clusters) to ensure data distribution and availability. This enables horizontal scaling without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich Query Language: MongoDB's query language supports a wide range of query operations, including filtering, sorting, and geospatial queries. It also provides support for full-text search, text indexing, and aggregation pipelines for complex data transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing to optimize query performance. You can create custom indexes on fields to speed up data retrieval. MongoDB also includes a default _id index for fast document retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial Capabilities: MongoDB offers geospatial indexing and queries, making it suitable for location-based applications. You can store and query geospatial data, such as points, lines, and polygons, efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication: MongoDB supports data replication to ensure data availability and fault tolerance. It uses replica sets, allowing multiple copies of data across different servers, with one primary and multiple secondary nodes for redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexible Data Models: MongoDB supports various data models beyond traditional document storage, including key-value, column-family, and graph data models. This flexibility allows you to choose the right data model for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Transactions: MongoDB introduced multi-document ACID transactions in version 4.0, ensuring data consistency and reliability for operations that span multiple documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Security: MongoDB provides robust security features, including authentication, authorization, role-based access control, and encryption at rest and in transit, to protect sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Framework: MongoDB's aggregation framework allows for advanced data transformation and analysis. It provides operators and expressions for performing complex data manipulations and computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Community and Ecosystem: MongoDB has a large and active open-source community, extensive documentation, and a rich ecosystem of drivers, libraries, and tools for various programming languages and platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud Integration: MongoDB Atlas is a fully managed database service offered by MongoDB, Inc. It allows you to run MongoDB in the cloud with automated provisioning, scaling, and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Monitoring and Management: MongoDB provides tools like MongoDB Compass for visual query building, monitoring tools, and management interfaces for easy database administration."
